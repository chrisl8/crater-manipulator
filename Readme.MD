## WebRTC Native GDExtension

In order to run this game anywhere other than the web browser, such as for testing, you need the "webrtc-native" plugin.

**This is already included in the bundle for the version of Godot that I am using**, but if you need to update it:

 - DELETE the `webrtc` folder.
 - Download the new version from https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-native/releases
 - Extract it and ensure it exists at the `webrtc` folder.

Again, you only need to do this if you are trying to use a newer version of Godot than I was using when I last committed this.
